Welcome to the Improve Your Self-image app. This app is here to guide you in improving your self-image.

People with a low self-image have become so accustomed to seeing themselves in a negative light that they have developed one or more fixed negative beliefs about themselves. They might think: 'I am not good enough' or 'I'll never succeed'. Because of this, they are more likely to focus on information that fits with this negative self-belief, such as whatever they are doing wrong instead of what they're doing right. Positive information about themselves they are less likely to notice and to remember.

Maybe you recognize being used to thinking about yourself in negative ways. Maybe you find it hard to come up with positive things about yourself. In that case, this app is for you.

How do you change a negative self-image? In this app you will gather more positive information about yourself. See the process as a scale. At the moment the negative side has a lot of weight on it because you have gathered a lot of information about the ways you're messing up, about what you don't like about yourself. To balance the scales, we have to gather more positive information, about everything you're doing right, your strengths, your potential.

The following weeks you will be asked to write in what we call a 'whitebook', a book filled with positive facts. In this book, you will write anything positive that happened that day, something you did or didn't do. Anything you felt content about, happy, or that made you proud. Big or small. That can be whenever you did something that you were afraid to do or whenever you took a moment for yourself. Maybe you did the laundry that day. Whatever you want to write down counts.
