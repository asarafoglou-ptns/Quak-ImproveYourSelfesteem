# Welcome to the Improve Your Self-Image App

This app is designed to help you enhance your self-image.

## Understanding Low Self-Image

People with a low self-image often see themselves in a negative light, developing fixed negative beliefs like "I am not good enough" or "I'll never succeed." As a result, they tend to focus on their mistakes rather than their successes, making it harder to notice and remember positive information about themselves.

## Is This App for You?

If you recognize these patterns of negative thinking and find it challenging to think positively about yourself, this app is for you.

## How to Change a Negative Self-Image

How can you change a negative self-image? This app will help you gather positive information about yourself. Think of your self-image as a scale. Currently, the negative side is heavier because you've collected a lot of negative information about yourself. To balance the scale, we need to add more positive informationâ€”about your strengths, successes, and potential.

## The Whitebook

Over the next few weeks, you'll be asked to write in a "whitebook," a book filled with positive facts. Each day, note down anything positive that happened, something you did or didn't do, or anything that made you feel content, happy, or proud. It can be something big or small, like facing a fear, taking time for yourself, or even doing the laundry. Every positive entry counts.
