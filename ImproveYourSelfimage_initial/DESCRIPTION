Description: An R shiny app for users with low self-esteem based on the 
    treatment for negative self-image by Manja de Neef (2022; 
    negatiefzelfbeeldbehandelen.nl). To improve self-esteem, users are asked 
    to log their positive experiences/things they did well that day in a 
    whitebook as well as define the positive self-image they want to strive
    for and give weekly ratings about how likely they think their defined
    positive self-image is to be true.
